Define a function called zen. This function does not accept any parameters and does not return

package. The copy must be named zen_copy.txt. Your copy must contain the following two changes:

A) The 19 aphorisms (sayings) which end with a period must be sorted alphabetically in the
zen_copy.txt file
B) The 19 aphorisms must also be numbered like this (note the period and space after the
numbers):

1. Although never is often better than *right* now.
2. Although practicality beats purity.
3. Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.

...and so on...

in a try-block.
